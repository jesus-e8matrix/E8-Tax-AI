  { q: `Is the loss on the sale of my home deductible?`, a: `Maybe. A loss on the sale or exchange of personal use property, including a capital loss on the sale of your home used as your personal residence at the time of sale, or loss attributable to the sale of part of your home that is used for personal purposes, isn't deductible. The only deductible losses associated with property (or a portion of property) are losses on property used in a trade or business, losses resulting from a transaction entered into for profit (for example, a loss on the sale of stock), and certain casualty losses. Until 2025, the only deductible casualty losses are those resulting from federally declared disasters.` },
  { q: `I own stock that became worthless last year. Is this a bad debt? How do I report my loss?`, a: `If you own securities, including stocks, and they become totally worthless, you have a capital loss but not a deduction for bad debt. Worthless securities also include securities that you abandon. To abandon a security, you must permanently surrender and relinquish all rights in the security and receive no consideration in exchange for it. Treat worthless securities as though they were sold or exchanged on the last day of the tax year, determine holding period to classify short- or long-term, and report on Schedule D (Form 1040) and Form 8949.` },
  { q: `I received a 1099-DIV showing a capital gain. Why do I have to report capital gains from my mutual funds if I never sold any shares of that mutual fund?`, a: `A mutual fund owns capital assets like stocks or bonds and passes gains from sales to you as capital gain distributions, even if you didn’t sell shares. These are reported to you on Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions. Report the amount in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV on Schedule D (Form 1040) or on line 7 of Form 1040 if you don’t need Schedule D.` },
  { q: `I purchased stock from my employer under a §423 employee stock purchase plan and received a Form 1099-B for selling it. How do I report this?`, a: `Under a §423 employee stock purchase plan, you report income or loss when you sell the stock. Determine if you met the holding period (1 year after transfer or 2 years after grant). If you meet it, most or all gain is capital; if not, part is ordinary income. Use Schedule D and Form 8949 to report. You may need to report some income as wages on Form 1040 or Schedule 1 depending on employer reporting.` },
  { q: `How do I figure the cost basis when the shares I'm selling were purchased at various times and at different prices?`, a: `The basis of your stocks is generally the purchase price plus any purchase costs. If you can’t identify which shares you sold, use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) rule. Brokers must report cost basis on Form 1099-B. Keep detailed records for all your purchases to establish basis.` },
  { q: `How do I report the sale of my second residence?`, a: `Your second residence is considered a capital asset. Report sales, exchanges, and other dispositions using Schedule D (Form 1040) and Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets.` },
  { q: `What is the basis of property received as a gift?`, a: `To determine the basis of gifted property, know: (1) the donor's adjusted basis, (2) the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift, and (3) any gift tax paid. If FMV < donor’s basis, use donor’s basis for gain and FMV for loss. If FMV ≥ donor’s basis, your basis is the donor’s basis. Adjust for gift tax if applicable.` },
  { q: `If I exclude the gain on the sale of my former principal residence this year, can I take the exclusion again if I sell my new principal residence in the future?`, a: `Yes. You can exclude the gain on the future sale if you meet the ownership and use tests and haven’t excluded a gain within the prior two years. You may qualify for a reduced exclusion for employment, health, or unforeseen circumstances. There’s no limit to the number of times you can claim the exclusion.` },
  { q: `How are reinvested dividends reported on my tax return?`, a: `Reinvested dividends used to purchase additional shares must be reported as dividend income. Report them with your other dividends on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If total dividends exceed $1,500, include Schedule B. Keep records for basis calculation when selling shares.` },
  { q: `I sold stock I received over several years through a dividend reinvestment plan. How do I compute the basis for this stock?`, a: `The basis is the cost of the shares purchased through reinvested dividends plus any adjustments. If you can’t identify which shares were sold, use FIFO. If detailed records are missing, reconstruct them using broker or public records. In some cases, you may elect to use the average basis method.` },
