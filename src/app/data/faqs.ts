  { q: `I am renting a house to my son and daughter-in-law. Can I claim rental expenses?`, a: `If you receive rental income from a dwelling unit, you may deduct certain expenses — but limitations apply depending on profit motive, personal use, and other factors:
• **Not-for-profit rentals** — You can deduct expenses only up to your rental income, and cannot carry forward losses. However, taxes and mortgage interest are still deductible.
• **Rental for profit** — If you rent a property you also use personally, the deduction rules depend on your personal-use days. Renting to relatives often counts as personal use unless rent equals fair market value and the property is used as their main home.
• **Passive activity losses** — Generally deductible only up to passive income; excess losses carry forward.
• **At-risk rules** — Losses are limited to the amount you have at risk in the activity.
See Publications 527 and 925 for detailed guidance.`, category: `Sale Trade Business Depreciation Rentals` },

  { q: `Can we move into our rental property, live there as our main home for two years, and sell it without having to pay capital gains tax?`, a: `Under **IRC Section 121**, you may exclude much of the gain from selling your main home if you meet ownership and use tests, but you cannot exclude gain:
• Allocable to periods of nonqualified use, or
• Equal to depreciation allowed or allowable after May 6, 1997.

  { q: `On what form do I deduct the standard mileage rate for my business travel, and do I also need to figure depreciation of the vehicle?`, a: `If you use the **standard mileage rate**, you cannot also depreciate the vehicle.
You can claim business vehicle use on:
• **Schedule C (Form 1040)** or **Schedule F (Form 1040)**, with **Form 4562** if applicable, or
• **Form 2106**, if you’re an Armed Forces reservist, government official paid on a fee basis, or qualified performing artist.

  { q: `I have a home office. Can I deduct expenses like mortgage, utilities, etc., but not deduct depreciation so that when I sell this house the basis won't be affected?`, a: `Under the **regular method**, no — depreciation must be considered at sale, whether or not claimed. The business-use portion of your home is depreciated over 39 years using straight-line depreciation. You must reduce your basis by the greater of depreciation allowed or allowable.
Under the **simplified method**, you may claim $5 per square foot (up to 300 sq ft) without affecting your home’s basis — depreciation is treated as zero.

  { q: `I've heard that I can sell my rental property and use the proceeds to purchase rental property of equal or greater value and the transaction is viewed just like an exchange in that the tax is deferred until the new property is sold. Is this true?`, a: `Yes. This is known as a **like-kind exchange** under **IRC Section 1031**.
When properly executed, it defers recognition of gain by shifting basis from the old to the new property.
Key rules:
• You can’t take actual or constructive receipt of sale proceeds.
• Use a **qualified intermediary** or trust to hold proceeds.
• Basis of new property equals basis of the old, adjusted for any money or non-like-kind property exchanged.
See Publication 544 and Form 8824 for details.`, category: `Sale Trade Business Depreciation Rentals` },
  { q: `We have incurred costs for substantial work on our residential rental property (roof, gutters, windows, furnace, painting). What are the IRS rules concerning capitalization and depreciation?`, a: `• **Replacements** of the roof, gutters, windows, doors, or furnace are **capital improvements** and must be depreciated over **27.5 years** using the straight-line method.
• **Painting** is typically a deductible repair, unless it’s part of a larger capital improvement project — then it’s capitalized.

  { q: `If I must deduct points over the life of my mortgage, and I have a 30-year mortgage, should I divide the points paid by 30 and enter that amount on Schedule A of Form 1040?`, a: `No. While you must deduct the points over the life of the loan ratably (equally), you don't divide the points by 30 years. Instead, you divide the points by the number of payments scheduled over the term of the loan (360 monthly payments in the case of a 30-year mortgage) and deduct points each year according to the number of payments you made in that year. If the loan ends prematurely, for example because you paid it off or refinanced with a different lender, the remaining points are deductible in that year. Any deductible points not included on Form 1098 should be entered on Schedule A, line 8c.`, category: `Individual` },
  { q: `We're about to hire employees and need to know how much federal income tax to withhold and where to send this money along with other employment taxes?`, a: `You'll need to secure a completed Form W-4 from each employee to know how much to withhold.

  { q: `I just started a small business and want to know if I must pay my income taxes quarterly or at the end of the year?`, a: `Individuals generally pay taxes through withholding or estimated tax payments.

  { q: `Are business gifts deductible?`, a: `You can deduct up to $25 per person per year for business gifts. Incidental costs like engraving or shipping don’t count toward the limit.

  { q: `How do you distinguish between a business and a hobby?`, a: `An activity is a business if it's carried on to make a profit.

  { q: `Can a married couple operate a business as a sole proprietorship or do they need to be a partnership?`, a: `A business jointly owned by spouses is generally a partnership unless they elect to be a qualified joint venture.

The instructions for these forms explain qualifications and calculation methods.`, category: `Childcare Credit Other Credits` },
  { q: `My spouse and I both work and are eligible for the child and dependent care credit. May I include my 5-year-old son's private kindergarten tuition as a qualified expense on Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses?`, a: `No. Tuition for kindergarten isn't a qualifying expense for the child and dependent care credit because it's considered an educational expense. However, before- or after-school care expenses for a child in kindergarten or higher may qualify even though tuition doesn't.`, category: `Childcare Credit Other Credits` },
  { q: `I'm thinking of paying a family member to babysit for my two-year-old child while I work.

  { q: `Why does my Form W-2 report a benefit of $5,000 in box 10 when my employer set aside $5,000 in wages for dependent care expenses under a dependent care assistance program?`, a: `The $5,000 in box 10 reflects the amount excluded from your taxable wages under a dependent care assistance program.

  { q: `I retired last year and started receiving Social Security payments. Do I have to pay taxes on my Social Security benefits?`, a: `Social Security benefits include monthly retirement, survivor and disability benefits. They don't include supplemental security income (SSI) payments, which aren't taxable. The net amount of Social Security benefits that you receive from the Social Security Administration is reported in Box 5 of Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement, and you report that amount on line 6a of Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. The taxable portion of the benefits depends on your total income and benefits for the year. Generally, your benefits may be taxable if the total of (1) one-half of your benefits plus (2) all other income, including tax-exempt interest, is greater than your filing status base amount: $25,000 for single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse; $25,000 for married filing separately and lived apart all year; $32,000 for married filing jointly; and $0 for married filing separately and lived with your spouse during the year.

If you didn’t receive your SSA-1099, you can request it via your my Social Security account starting February 1.`, category: `Social Security Income` },
  { q: `Are Social Security survivor benefits for children considered taxable income?`, a: `Yes, under certain circumstances, although a child generally won't receive enough additional income to make the child's Social Security benefits taxable. The taxability of benefits must be determined using the income of the person entitled to receive the benefits. If both you and your child receive benefits, calculate taxability separately. Compare the base amount for the child’s filing status ($25,000 if single) with the total of one-half of the child's benefits plus all other income (including tax-exempt interest). If that total exceeds the base amount, part of the child's benefits may be taxable. Worksheets in Publication 915 and the Instructions for Form 1040 can help you determine this.`, category: `Social Security Income` },
  { q: `I received Social Security benefits this year that were back benefits for prior years. Do I amend my returns for those prior years? Are the back benefits paid in this year for past years taxable this year?`, a: `You can't amend prior year returns to reflect Social Security benefits received in a lump-sum in the current year. You must include the taxable part of the lump-sum payment (reported on Form SSA-1099) in your current year’s income, even if the payment covers earlier years. You can either: (1) use current year income to figure the taxable part, or (2) elect to figure the taxable part separately for earlier years using the lump-sum election method (check box on line 6c of Form 1040 or 1040-SR). Worksheets in Publication 915 explain how to calculate this.`, category: `Social Security Income` },
  { q: `My electronic tax return keeps getting rejected because a dependent's Social Security number (SSN) is used more than once on one return or is used on another return. What should I do?`, a: `If you have verified the SSNs for all your dependents with the Social Security Administration and no one else is authorized to claim them, the following may apply: the SSN also appears as a filer, spouse, or dependent on another return for the same year. This could be a typo or an attempt by another party to claim benefits using your dependent's SSN. The IRS has security measures to ensure accuracy. If you've verified the SSN and found no errors, you can e-file your 2024 return if the primary taxpayer has a current IP PIN. Otherwise, file a paper return for prior years.

  { q: `I received a Form 1099-NEC instead of a Form W-2. I'm not self-employed and don't have a business. How do I report this income?`, a: `If payment for services you provided is listed on Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation, the payer is treating you as self-employed, also referred to as an independent contractor. You don't necessarily have to have a business for payments for your services to be reported on Form 1099-NEC. You may simply perform services as a nonemployee. The payer has determined that an employer-employee relationship doesn't exist in your case. If you weren't an employee of the payer, where you report the income depends on whether your activity is a trade or business. You're in a self-employed trade or business if your primary purpose is to make a profit and your activity is regular and continuous. If you're in a self-employed trade or business, you must include payments for your services on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business. If you're self-employed, you'll also need to complete Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax and pay self-employment tax on your net earnings of $400 or more. If you're not self-employed but still generate income, report it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8j. If you believe you may be an employee, see Publication 1779 for distinctions between independent contractors and employees.`, category: `Interest Dividends Income` },

How do I compute the basis for this stock?`, a: `The basis is the cost of the shares purchased through reinvested dividends plus any adjustments.
