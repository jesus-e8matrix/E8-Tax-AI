"My electronic tax return keeps getting rejected because a dependent's Social Security number (SSN) is used more than once on one return or is used on another return. What should I do?","If you have verified the SSNs for all your dependents with the Social Security Administration and no one else is authorized to claim them, the following may apply: the SSN also appears as a filer, spouse, or dependent on another return for the same year. This could be a typo or an attempt by another party to claim benefits using your dependent's SSN. The IRS has security measures to ensure accuracy. If you've verified the SSN and found no errors, you can e-file your 2024 return if the primary taxpayer has a current IP PIN. Otherwise, file a paper return for prior years. Don't attach extra documents; the IRS will contact you if needed. For assistance, call 800-829-1040.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
"My spouse and I will be filing an original joint Form 1040 series tax return. Can we file our return electronically?","Yes. You can file an original Form 1040 series tax return electronically using any filing status. E-filing is faster, safer, and more accurate than mailing because it's transmitted directly to IRS systems.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
"I filed electronically and my tax return was rejected. What do I do now?","You should receive an explanation of why your return was rejected. If you made an error such as entering a wrong SSN, EIN, or misspelled name, correct it and refile electronically. Some errors require mailing the return. To file timely after rejection, mail your return by the later of the due date (including extensions) or within 10 days of rejection notice. Include a rejection explanation, a copy of the rejection notice, and write 'Rejected Electronic Return – (Date)' in red on the first page. Sign your return. For questions, call 800-829-1040.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
"What software is endorsed or approved by the IRS for IRS e-file?","The IRS partners with many companies that offer electronic filing services, but it doesn't endorse or approve specific software. See IRS Free File or Electronic filing options for business and self-employed taxpayers for more information.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
"If I file my Form 1040 or 1040-SR electronically, what do I do with my Forms W-2?","Use the information from your Forms W-2 to complete your return. Give your Forms W-2 to your authorized IRS e-file provider before they transmit your return. You don’t need to send them to the IRS; keep them with your records.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
