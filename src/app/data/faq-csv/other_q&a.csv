"Does the IRS have information about retirement plans","Yes, please refer to Retirement plans frequently asked questions (FAQs).","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/retirement-plans"
"If the custodial parent releases a claim to exemption for a child by signing Form 8332, may the noncustodial parent claim the child as a qualifying child for the earned income credit?","No. The noncustodial parent may not claim a child as a qualifying child for the earned income credit based solely on the custodial parent's release of a claim to exemption. The custodial parent may still claim the child if the residency and other requirements are met. See Publication 501 for definitions of custodial and noncustodial parents.","https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/earned-income-tax-credit-faqs"
"To claim my child as my qualifying child for the earned income credit, must I also be entitled to claim that child as a dependent?","Not necessarily. You may still be eligible to claim the EIC even if you released a claim to a dependency exemption under the special rule for divorced or separated parents. Form 8332 only applies to the dependency exemption and child tax credit, not the EIC. However, tie-breaker rules may apply if multiple taxpayers qualify.","https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/earned-income-tax-credit-faqs"
"Is child support considered earned income when calculating the earned income credit?","No. Child support isn’t considered earned income for EIC purposes. Other items that aren’t earned income include interest, pensions, Social Security, alimony, welfare benefits, workers’ compensation, unemployment, nontaxable foster care payments, and veterans’ benefits.","https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/earned-income-tax-credit-faqs"
"If both unmarried parents want to claim the earned income credit, which parent is entitled to claim it?","If unmarried parents meet all EIC requirements, they may choose which parent will claim the qualifying child. If both claim the same child, the IRS applies tie-breaker rules, generally giving priority to the parent with whom the child lived longer, or the one with higher adjusted gross income (AGI) if time is equal.","https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/earned-income-tax-credit-faqs"
"My child was born and only lived 40 minutes. Can this child be my qualifying child for the earned income credit and the child tax credit?","Yes. A child born alive or who died during the year is treated as having lived with you for more than half the year if your home was (or would have been) the child’s home. You may write 'DIED' in place of the SSN and attach a copy of the birth or death certificate or hospital record. You may qualify for both the EIC and child tax credit if other requirements are met.","https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/earned-income-tax-credit-faqs"

"I have a small business. Am I required to file Forms W-2 electronically?","Employers filing 10 or more information returns, including Forms W-2, must file electronically unless granted a waiver by the IRS. All employers are encouraged to file Forms W-2 electronically. The following information returns count toward the 10-return threshold: Forms 1099 series, 1098 series, 1097-BTC, 3921, 3922, 5498 series, 8027, 8851, W-2, W-2G, 8955-SSA, 1094-B, 1095-B, 1094-C, 1095-C, 1042-S, and 8966. Forms W-2 are filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA), whether on paper or electronically. For specifications, visit SSA.gov/employer or call 800-772-6270 (TTY 800-325-0778).","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filers"
"How do I request approval to file information returns electronically?","To file information returns electronically, use the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system to transmit forms such as 1097-BTC, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, W-2G, 1042-S, 8027, 8596, or 8955-SSA. Before using FIRE, obtain a Transmitter Control Code (TCC) by completing an online Information Return (IR) Application for TCC. If you previously used a service bureau’s TCC and want to transmit your own files, you must apply for your own TCC. Applications are available on the FIRE page. Files must meet the correct format as described in Publication 1220. Once approved, the IRS will issue your TCC. You do not need to reapply yearly, but you must apply again if you haven’t used your TCC for three years. Filers can also use IRIS to e-file Form 1099 returns, AIR for ACA forms, and IDES for FATCA Form 8966 transmissions.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filers"
"I must start receiving distributions from my IRA & 401(k) accounts. How do I determine the amount I must withdraw each year to avoid a penalty?","Generally, the required minimum distribution (RMD) must be calculated separately for each account. You determine the RMD by dividing the prior December 31 balance of the account by a life expectancy factor from IRS tables in Publication 590-B. Use: the Uniform Lifetime Table (Table III) for most individuals, the Joint Life and Last Survivor Table (Table II) if your spouse is more than 10 years younger and the sole beneficiary, or the Single Life Expectancy Table (Table I) if you are a beneficiary. If you have multiple IRAs, you can total the RMDs and withdraw from any one or more accounts. See Publication 590-B for IRAs and Publication 575 for 401(k) plans.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/other"
"How do I deduct the administration expenses of my father's estate?","You can deduct estate administration expenses either as an expense against the estate tax or against the estate’s income tax, but not both. Deduct from the gross estate on Form 706 (estate tax) or from the estate’s income on Form 1041 (income tax). Deductible expenses may include fiduciary fees, attorney or accountant fees, and expenses for managing or conserving property. See Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators, and the instructions for Forms 706 and 1041 for more details.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/other"
"I exercised my rights to receive life insurance distributions before death. Are these proceeds taxable?","Yes, if you surrender a life insurance policy for cash, any proceeds exceeding your total premiums paid (minus refunds, rebates, or unpaid loans) are taxable. You should receive Form 1099-R showing the gross and taxable amounts. Report these on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. For more guidance, see Publication 525 and Publication 554.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/other"
"Are the proceeds I receive from a reverse mortgage taxable to me?","No. Reverse mortgage payments are not taxable because they are considered loan proceeds, not income. You retain title to your home. The loan (plus interest) becomes due when you move, sell, die, or the loan term ends. Interest on a reverse mortgage is deductible only when actually paid and may be limited if the proceeds were not used to buy, build, or improve the home. See Publication 936 and Publication 554 for more details.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/other"
"How can I recognize an abusive tax avoidance transaction?","Abusive tax avoidance transactions claim inflated or disproportionate tax benefits relative to the actual investment and are primarily designed to evade taxes. Legitimate investments produce real income or appreciation and involve risk proportional to the investment. Abusive schemes are often marketed based on tax savings. For details, see the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Notice 2009-59 (listed transactions), and Notice 2009-55 (transactions of interest). Up-to-date lists are available under 'Recognized abusive and listed transactions' and 'Transactions of interest' on the IRS website.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/other"
