"When are quarterly estimated tax payments due?","For estimated tax purposes, the year is divided into four payment periods, each with a specific due date. If you don't pay enough tax by each due date, you may owe a penalty even if you’re due a refund when you file your annual return.
Payment periods and due dates:
- Jan. 1 – Mar. 31 → April 15

- Jun. 1 – Aug. 31 → Sept. 15
- Sept. 1 – Dec. 31 → Jan. 15 of the following year
