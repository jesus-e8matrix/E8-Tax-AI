"I received a Form 1099-NEC instead of a Form W-2. I'm not self-employed and don't have a business. How do I report this income?","If payment for services you provided is listed on Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation, the payer is treating you as self-employed, also referred to as an independent contractor. You don't necessarily have to have a business for payments for your services to be reported on Form 1099-NEC. You may simply perform services as a nonemployee. The payer has determined that an employer-employee relationship doesn't exist in your case. If you weren't an employee of the payer, where you report the income depends on whether your activity is a trade or business. You're in a self-employed trade or business if your primary purpose is to make a profit and your activity is regular and continuous. If you're in a self-employed trade or business, you must include payments for your services on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business. If you're self-employed, you'll also need to complete Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax and pay self-employment tax on your net earnings of $400 or more. If you're not self-employed but still generate income, report it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8j. If you believe you may be an employee, see Publication 1779 for distinctions between independent contractors and employees.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income"
"Is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income?","Generally, the gross proceeds from the sale of inherited property are included in gross income when considering the need to file. If there’s a filing requirement, report the sale on Schedule D (Form 1040) and Form 8949. The basis of inherited property is generally its fair market value at the date of the decedent's death or the alternate valuation date if elected on Form 706. If you sell the property for more than your basis, you have a taxable gain. For reporting details, see Publication 550 and Publication 559. An accuracy-related penalty may apply if the reported basis exceeds the final estate value.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income"
