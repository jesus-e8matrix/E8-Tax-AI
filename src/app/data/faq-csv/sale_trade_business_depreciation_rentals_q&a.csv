"I am renting a house to my son and daughter-in-law. Can I claim rental expenses?","If you receive rental income from a dwelling unit, you may deduct certain expenses — but limitations apply depending on profit motive, personal use, and other factors:
• **Not-for-profit rentals** — You can deduct expenses only up to your rental income, and cannot carry forward losses. However, taxes and mortgage interest are still deductible.
• **Rental for profit** — If you rent a property you also use personally, the deduction rules depend on your personal-use days. Renting to relatives often counts as personal use unless rent equals fair market value and the property is used as their main home.
• **Passive activity losses** — Generally deductible only up to passive income; excess losses carry forward.
• **At-risk rules** — Losses are limited to the amount you have at risk in the activity.

"What form(s) do we need to fill out to report the sale of rental property?","Report the gain or loss from the sale of rental property on **Form 4797**, *Sales of Business Property*, or on **Form 8949**, *Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets*, depending on the rental’s purpose.
Individuals generally file **Schedule D (Form 1040)** with Form 4797 or 8949.
See Publications 544 and 550, and instructions for Form 4797 and Schedule D.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/sale-or-trade-of-business-depreciation-rentals"
"Can we move into our rental property, live there as our main home for two years, and sell it without having to pay capital gains tax?","Under **IRC Section 121**, you may exclude much of the gain from selling your main home if you meet ownership and use tests, but you cannot exclude gain:
• Allocable to periods of nonqualified use, or
• Equal to depreciation allowed or allowable after May 6, 1997.
If business or rental use occurred, report the sale on **Form 4797**. Otherwise, use **Form 8949** and **Schedule D**.
See Publication 523 for full details and examples.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/sale-or-trade-of-business-depreciation-rentals"
"On what form do I deduct the standard mileage rate for my business travel, and do I also need to figure depreciation of the vehicle?","If you use the **standard mileage rate**, you cannot also depreciate the vehicle.
You can claim business vehicle use on:
• **Schedule C (Form 1040)** or **Schedule F (Form 1040)**, with **Form 4562** if applicable, or
• **Form 2106**, if you’re an Armed Forces reservist, government official paid on a fee basis, or qualified performing artist.
Alternatively, using the **actual expense method** requires calculating depreciation.
See Publications 463, 544, and 946 for guidance.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/sale-or-trade-of-business-depreciation-rentals"
"I have a home office. Can I deduct expenses like mortgage, utilities, etc., but not deduct depreciation so that when I sell this house the basis won't be affected?","Under the **regular method**, no — depreciation must be considered at sale, whether or not claimed. The business-use portion of your home is depreciated over 39 years using straight-line depreciation. You must reduce your basis by the greater of depreciation allowed or allowable.
Under the **simplified method**, you may claim $5 per square foot (up to 300 sq ft) without affecting your home’s basis — depreciation is treated as zero.

"I've heard that I can sell my rental property and use the proceeds to purchase rental property of equal or greater value and the transaction is viewed just like an exchange in that the tax is deferred until the new property is sold. Is this true?","Yes. This is known as a **like-kind exchange** under **IRC Section 1031**.
When properly executed, it defers recognition of gain by shifting basis from the old to the new property.
Key rules:
• You can’t take actual or constructive receipt of sale proceeds.
• Use a **qualified intermediary** or trust to hold proceeds.
• Basis of new property equals basis of the old, adjusted for any money or non-like-kind property exchanged.
See Publication 544 and Form 8824 for details.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/sale-or-trade-of-business-depreciation-rentals"
"We have incurred costs for substantial work on our residential rental property (roof, gutters, windows, furnace, painting). What are the IRS rules concerning capitalization and depreciation?","• **Replacements** of the roof, gutters, windows, doors, or furnace are **capital improvements** and must be depreciated over **27.5 years** using the straight-line method.
• **Painting** is typically a deductible repair, unless it’s part of a larger capital improvement project — then it’s capitalized.
Small taxpayers with average annual gross receipts ≤ $10 million may elect under the **safe harbor** to expense repairs and improvements under certain thresholds.
