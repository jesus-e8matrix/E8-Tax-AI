"My electronic tax return keeps getting rejected because a dependent's Social Security number (SSN) is used more than once on one return or is used on another return. What should I do?","If you have verified the SSNs for all your dependents with the Social Security Administration and no one else is authorized to claim them, the following may apply: the SSN also appears as a filer, spouse, or dependent on another return for the same year. This could be a typo or an attempt by another party to claim benefits using your dependent's SSN. The IRS has security measures to ensure accuracy. If you've verified the SSN and found no errors, you can e-file your 2024 return if the primary taxpayer has a current IP PIN. Otherwise, file a paper return for prior years. Don't attach extra documents; the IRS will contact you if needed. For assistance, call 800-829-1040.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file"
