"I retired last year and started receiving Social Security payments. Do I have to pay taxes on my Social Security benefits?","Social Security benefits include monthly retirement, survivor and disability benefits. They don't include supplemental security income (SSI) payments, which aren't taxable. The net amount of Social Security benefits that you receive from the Social Security Administration is reported in Box 5 of Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement, and you report that amount on line 6a of Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. The taxable portion of the benefits depends on your total income and benefits for the year. Generally, your benefits may be taxable if the total of (1) one-half of your benefits plus (2) all other income, including tax-exempt interest, is greater than your filing status base amount: $25,000 for single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse; $25,000 for married filing separately and lived apart all year; $32,000 for married filing jointly; and $0 for married filing separately and lived with your spouse during the year. Use worksheets in the Instructions for Form 1040 or Publication 915 to calculate. If you didn’t receive your SSA-1099, you can request it via your my Social Security account starting February 1.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income"
"Are Social Security survivor benefits for children considered taxable income?","Yes, under certain circumstances, although a child generally won't receive enough additional income to make the child's Social Security benefits taxable. The taxability of benefits must be determined using the income of the person entitled to receive the benefits. If both you and your child receive benefits, calculate taxability separately. Compare the base amount for the child’s filing status ($25,000 if single) with the total of one-half of the child's benefits plus all other income (including tax-exempt interest). If that total exceeds the base amount, part of the child's benefits may be taxable. Worksheets in Publication 915 and the Instructions for Form 1040 can help you determine this.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income"
"I received Social Security benefits this year that were back benefits for prior years. Do I amend my returns for those prior years? Are the back benefits paid in this year for past years taxable this year?","You can't amend prior year returns to reflect Social Security benefits received in a lump-sum in the current year. You must include the taxable part of the lump-sum payment (reported on Form SSA-1099) in your current year’s income, even if the payment covers earlier years. You can either: (1) use current year income to figure the taxable part, or (2) elect to figure the taxable part separately for earlier years using the lump-sum election method (check box on line 6c of Form 1040 or 1040-SR). Worksheets in Publication 915 explain how to calculate this.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income"
