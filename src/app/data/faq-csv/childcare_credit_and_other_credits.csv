"May a noncustodial parent claim the child tax credit for his or her child?","Yes, a noncustodial parent may be eligible to claim the child tax credit for their child as long as they are allowed to claim the child as a dependent and otherwise qualify. The noncustodial parent must attach Form 8332, Release/Revocation of Release of Claim to Exemption for Child by Custodial Parent, or a substantially similar statement signed by the custodial parent to claim the child as a dependent.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"

You must file Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR and attach Schedule 8812 for the CTC, ACTC, or ODC, and Form 2441 for the child and dependent care credit.

"My spouse and I both work and are eligible for the child and dependent care credit. May I include my 5-year-old son's private kindergarten tuition as a qualified expense on Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses?","No. Tuition for kindergarten isn't a qualifying expense for the child and dependent care credit because it's considered an educational expense. However, before- or after-school care expenses for a child in kindergarten or higher may qualify even though tuition doesn't.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"I'm thinking of paying a family member to babysit for my two-year-old child while I work. May I claim this cost as a childcare expense even though my family member isn't a registered daycare provider? Who's responsible for paying employment taxes on the money I pay for this care?","Payments to a family member may qualify as childcare expenses if you meet all requirements, but not if paid to your spouse, the child's parent, someone you can claim as a dependent, or your child under 19. Whether you or the family member pays employment taxes depends on if they are an employee or self-employed. See Publication 15-A, 15, and 926 for guidance on determining employee vs. contractor status and household employer rules.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"Do tuition and related expenses paid to attend a private high school qualify for an education credit?","No. Private high school expenses don’t qualify for education credits because a high school isn’t an eligible educational institution. Eligible institutions are accredited colleges, universities, vocational schools, or other postsecondary institutions that participate in federal student aid programs.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"I heard there's a credit for hiring certain groups of workers, such as veterans or ex-felons. Is that the same thing as the work opportunity tax credit?","Yes. The work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) provides incentives for employers to hire individuals from targeted groups with high unemployment or barriers to employment. The credit is generally 40% of qualified wages for employees working at least 400 hours. Employers must pre-screen with Form 8850 and get certification from the state workforce agency within 28 days of the employee starting work.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"My babysitter refused to provide me with her Social Security number. May I still claim the amount I paid her for childcare while I worked? If so, how do I claim these childcare expenses on my tax return?","Yes, you may still claim the child and dependent care credit if you show due diligence in requesting the provider's identifying number. Report the care provider’s available info (name and address) on Form 2441, write 'See Attached Statement,' and attach a note explaining your attempt to obtain the SSN or TIN.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"What expenses qualify for an education credit?","Qualified tuition and related expenses include tuition and required fees for enrollment or attendance at an eligible postsecondary institution. For the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), this includes required course materials. For the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC), it includes tuition and fees for degree or job-skill courses. Expenses like room, board, insurance, transportation, and optional fees don’t qualify.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"Why does my Form W-2 report a benefit of $5,000 in box 10 when my employer set aside $5,000 in wages for dependent care expenses under a dependent care assistance program?","The $5,000 in box 10 reflects the amount excluded from your taxable wages under a dependent care assistance program. This benefit reduces your taxable income because you’re not taxed on those wages. You must still complete and attach Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses, to your tax return.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
"Who can claim the American opportunity tax credit?","You can claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) if you paid qualified tuition and related expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for the first four years of postsecondary education.

The maximum credit is $2,500 per eligible student, and 40% (up to $1,000) is refundable.","https://www.irs.gov/faqs/childcare-credit-other-credits"
